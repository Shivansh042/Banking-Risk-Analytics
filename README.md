 🏦 Banking Risk Analytics  

A data analytics project focused on leveraging data analytics to address risk management challenges in banking and financial services. The goal was to help banks minimize losses from loan defaults while improving decision-making around client engagement, deposits, and lending activities. using **Power BI, PostgreSQL, and Excel**.  

This project demonstrates **end-to-end risk analytics** — from database querying and data cleaning to building **interactive BI dashboards** that uncover financial risk patterns and customer behavior.
